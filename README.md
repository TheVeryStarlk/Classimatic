## About
Classimatic is a CLI tool for converting Classic `.schematic` files into `ClassicWorld` files for the [ClassiCube](https://github.com/ClassiCube/ClassiCube) client.

> ⚠️ I have not tested if the Linux and macOS binaries work.

## Usage
Head to the [releases](https://github.com/TheVeryStarlk/Classimatic/releases/tag/first) section and download the binaries for your OS. Run `Classimatic`'s executable and provide it with the file path as an argument `Classimatic --path world.schematic`.
